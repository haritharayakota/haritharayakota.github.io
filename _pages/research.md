My research focuses on building multimodal and vision-centric learning systems:

- Designed an end-to-end multimodal framework for autonomous driving
- Developed and evaluated navigation control classification models using deep learning
- Integrated videos and text data for Visual Question Answering with LLMs
- Built multimodal fusion models for disease classification by integrating images and text modalities

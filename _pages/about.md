I am a Ph.D. researcher in Information Technology at the University of Nebraskaâ€“Omaha with expertise in machine learning, deep learning, computer vision, multimodal fusion, robotics, and biomedical information retrieval. My research centers on advancing vision-centric and multimodal learning systems with strong real-world applications in autonomous systems and healthcare.

I currently lead three primary research projects:

- **End-to-End Autonomous Driving**  
  Developing a multimodal end-to-end framework that integrates image and LiDAR data to accurately predict navigation control commands in autonomous driving.

- **Vision-Language Understanding for Autonomous Driving**  
  Leveraging large language models (LLMs) to fuse video and textual data, enabling contextual reasoning and interpretable decision-making in dynamic driving environments.

- **Biomedical Diagnosis**  
  Constructing multimodal fusion models combining medical imaging and clinical text to enhance disease classification accuracy and support clinical decision-making.

My work bridges perception, reasoning, and multimodal integration, aiming to push the boundaries of reliable, generalizable AI systems in safety-critical domains. I am committed to contributing to academic excellence through innovative research, collaboration, and mentorship.
